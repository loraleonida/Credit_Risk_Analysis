# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit risk with six different machine learning models: RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEEN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier.

## Results: 
- RandomOverSampler
  - Balanced accuracy score: 0.64
  - Precision score: 0.99
  - Recall score: 0.59
  
- SMOTE
  - Balanced accuracy score: 0.66
  - Precision score: 0.99
  - Recall score: 0.69
  
- ClusterCentroids
  - Balanced accuracy score: 0.54
  - Precision score: 0.99
  - Recall score: 0.40
  
- SMOTEENN
  - Balanced accuracy score: 0.65
  - Precision score: 0.99
  - Recall score: 0.57
  
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier
  - Balanced accuracy score: 0.79
  - Precision score: 0.99
  - Recall score: 0.87
  
- EasyEnsembleClassifier
  - Balanced accuracy score: 0.93
  - Precision score: 0.99
  - Recall score: 0.94

## Summary: 

The results show that the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and the EasyEnsembleClassifier were the most accurate at predicting credit risk from their balanced accuracy scores. They also had the highest recall scores of all six models tested. My recommendation would be to use the EasyEnsembleClassifier model, as it had the highest balanced accuracy score, precision score, and recall score of all six models.
